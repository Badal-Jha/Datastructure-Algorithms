@MrsColombo I had this problem too but managed to solve it, the error is that ur computer has saved a git username and password so if you shift to another account the error 403 will appear. Below is the solution
For Windows you can find the keys here:

control panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials

Next remove the Github keys.

//__builtin_popcount()//

__builtin_popcount is a built in function of GCC compiler not of any header file of C++.

__builtin_popcount(int) function is used to count the number of one’s(set bits) in an integer.

prototype of __builtin_popcount is as follows

int __builtin_popcount(int N)

ex- int n=__builtin_popcount(4);

cout<<n;

Output: 1
__builtin_popcount = int
__builtin_popcountl = long int
__builtin_popcountll = long long

If N is negative , it will still give correct answer (as negative numbers are stored in memory in 2’s compliment form).

2. __builtin_ctz(x) : count number of zeroes at the end of number

You can also make your own function to count number of set bits

int count_setbits(int N)

{ int cnt=0;

while(N>0)

{

cnt+=(N&1);

N=N>>1;

}

return cnt;

}

But the above function will work fine only for positive numbers.
